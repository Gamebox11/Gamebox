# 3.4 Security

● Cryptography: GameBox technology converts plain text into cipher text, and not only focuses on information confidentiality, but also information integrity verification, digital signatures, and all information security issues generated in distributed computing from internal and external attacks.

 

● Gradually open source: GameBox will be built around open source projects, including the open source community composed by users, Club and industry developers, etc. Among them, open source business model, open source community operation and open source risk governance are the three major links of ecological development, which will be actively promoted by the platform.

 

● Industry consensus: GameBox's demand for flow is permanent, and the flow strategy will accompany the continued operation of the platform. The rapid growth of the platform's flow will follow the promotion of key games on the platform, and the platform will also rely on its own research and external cooperation to jointly build a complete platform ecology.
