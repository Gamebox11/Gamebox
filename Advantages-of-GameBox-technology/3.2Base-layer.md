# 3.2 Base layer

● Computing power: to provide all users with stable, sustainable computing power and even supercomputing functions, to ensure the stable growth of user assets.

 

● Storage: platform account system services, the platform of a large amount of data scattered in multiple nodes, thus enhancing the reliability of data, availability, remote disaster recovery rate and other features.

 

● GameChain public chain: PoA algorithm is used in ETH code in the past, mainly used for the development and testing of network use, need to pass the centralized authorization node to allow the block. GameChain consensus algorithm is a secondary development based on Go-Ethereum V1.10.12 code. PoA algorithm is changed into PoS algorithm with master node as unit. No authorization is required. In addition, the pledged currency is stored in the master node contract and can be retrieved at any time. The node server will not store the user's currency and private key to ensure asset security.

 

● Predictor: as a block chain middleware, it helps intelligently connect external sub-chain data and systems to realize data interaction between the block chain world and the real world. It can be applied to lending, financial derivatives and prediction markets.

 

●VR support: VR hardware support, such as head-mounted display device, input device, locator, etc.
