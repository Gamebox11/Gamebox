# 4.3 The DAO

GameBox, as a new Web 3.0 game recommendation platform, will also be a game platform under community autonomy.

The platform community is divided into the main community and the game community, and the concept of DAO will be used for community autonomy. Proposal types include key game promotion proposals, bidding proposals and so on.

In the community ecosystem, "proposers" and "talkers" should be fully aligned with the interests of the platform/community, not only do they require substantial pledges, but they also have experience of previous contributions to the platform community, and the topic will be managed in the form of DAO.
