# 4.2 KOL/ Developer

KOL is the opinion leader generated by the platform players, which will be formed freely in the early stage and actively cultivated by the community /Club in the later stage. In the platform, KOL has two key roles, one is to lead core or sub-core players to better play the game, and the other is to advise rule trust in the Web 3.0 era, which focuses on identity, privacy and ownership.

 

In THE KOL rules, fixed income will be obtained from the community and the platform, and users will use the way of reward/appreciation to THE KOL, so as to create a special relationship of "value sharing and value recognition" between KOL and users.

 

The goal and pursuit of KOL should be the value certification system of the platform's open algorithm. The community will reward KOL according to the value system of KOL. In addition, the algorithm of the value system can be changed through community voting.

 

The positioning of the developer is to be a high-quality team with research and development ability at the beginning, and to obtain the help of initial seed users and initial funds through the proposal of the community. As the GameBox SDK gets better and better, the barriers to developing gameplay classes will get lower and lower, and anyone can become a developer through the SDK. The expected mature model of the platform is CLUB's cooperation with developers /KOL to upgrade to a mature and stable content creation model.
