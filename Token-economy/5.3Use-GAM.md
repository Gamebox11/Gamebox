# 5.3 Use GAM

The GAM will serve as a medium of exchange between participants in the GameBox ecosystem. GAM was introduced to provide a more convenient and secure means of payment and settlement for participants interacting within the GameBox ecosystem, such as supporting digital goods or in-game items. GAM currently has no funding plans.
